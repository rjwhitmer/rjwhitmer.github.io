            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>My name is Bob Whitmer and I am a software engineer. 
                I currently live in Denver, Colorado with my growing family and two dogs!
                Outside of development, I enjoy playing soccer, snowboarding, and beating 
                anyone who dares challenge me in Mario Kart.
